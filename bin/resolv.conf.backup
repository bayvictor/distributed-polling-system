#Most of the time, your ISP automatically assigns a primary and secondary DNS server when your router or computer requests network information via DHCP. But what if those ISP-provided DNS servers aren't reliable or you're troubleshooting an issue and you suspect that DNS might not be working properly?

#Luckily there are several, completely free-to-use, public DNS servers that you can use instead of the ones assigned to you.
#Public DNS Servers (Updated December 2012)
#Provider 	Primary DNS Server 	Secondary DNS Server

#[1] The DNS servers listed above as Level3 will automatically route to the nearest DNS server operated by Level3 Communications, the company that provides most of the ISPs in the US their access to the Internet backbone.

#[2] Google also offers IPv6 public DNS servers: 2001:4860:4860::8888 and 2001:4860:4860::8844.

#[3] Securly's DNS servers block adult content by default, including of course X-rated content but also adult oriented pages on websites like Wikipedia, adult themed searches on Google, and more. The grown-ups in the house can sign up here to bypass all restrictions.

#[4] The Norton ConnectSafe DNS servers listed above block sites hosting malware, phishing schemes, and scams. Use 198.153.192.50 and 198.153.194.50 to block those sites plus those with pornographic content. Use 198.153.192.60 and 198.153.194.60 to block all previously mentioned site categories plus those Norton deems "non-family friendly."

#[5] ScrubIT also offers "filtered" DNS servers that restrict access to pornographic and malicious web sites. Those DNS servers are 67.138.54.100 and 207.225.209.66 and you can read more about it here.

#[6] The DNS servers listed here for OpenNIC are just two of many in the US and across the globe. Instead of using the OpenNIC DNS servers listed above, see their complete list of public DNS servers here and use two that are close to you. OpenNIC also offers some IPv6 public DNS servers.

#[7] These Public-Root DNS servers are the only two currently operating in the United States but if you're located ouside the US, see their complete list here and choose the best servers based on your location.
