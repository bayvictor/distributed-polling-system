   2. that's not fun :)

So, let's get to work and take care of all dependencies needed to build mediatomb from source. This procedure was successfully performed on Ubuntu 8.04 and 8.10.

1) Installing ffmpegthumbnailer

ffmpegthumbnailer is a small tool which uses ffmpeg to generate video thumbnails. These thumbnails will be displayed by mediatomb while you're browsing your video collection.

[Updated on 2008/01/02] This supposes that you have built ffmpeg. If not, you may be missing a number of libraries: please check the comments below for solutions.

First, we need to install libpng:"

All right. Let's power up the PS3 and see if it can see the mediatomb server.



Yes it does. Now using the mediatomb GUI, in just a few clicks, I added some pictures and music to my library. They are almost immediately visible on the PS3:



Not bad at all! That's it for the mediatomb installation. There's still plenty of configuration to do, but this will be the subject of another entry :)

    Thanks for this, linking to it from my blog.

    A little pointer to anyone compiling the ffmpegthumbnailer that gets the error

    configure: error: +Could not find ffmpeg. Please update PKG_CONFIG_PATH to point at location of ffmpeg pkgconfig files directory.

    Run this..."

#    cat config.log | grep "No package"

echo "    and that will tell you what packages you need to download. Make sure they are the dev ones!

    i.e. mine said

    No package 'libavformat' found
    No package 'libswscale' found

    so i ran

    sudo apt-get install -y libavformat-dev libswscale-dev

    Hi JS,

    I've really enjoyed your blog and using your howtos. I'm having a problem compiling mediatomb though.
    I started with your other tutorial compiling ffmpeg + x264 + MP3 + Xvid + AMR on Ubuntu (everything
    appears to have gone smooth) and have since moved on to this mediatomb howto. When I 'make'
    mediatomb I receive the following.

    /usr/local/lib/libavformat.so: undefined reference to `av_fifo_realloc2'
    /usr/local/lib/libavcodec.so.52: undefined reference to `av_memcpy_backptr'
    /usr/local/lib/libavcodec.so.52: undefined reference to `av_lfg_init'

    I read on another one of your howtos how someone else was having similar issues. It was recommended
    to remove the a and so files for the offending. Where do I delete from if these files exist? My /usr/lib
    or the source directory for what I'm compiling?

    Thanks for some great reading!

    I get the same.

    Did apt-get remove libavcodec-dev, then deleted libavcodec.a and libavcodec.so from /usr/local/lib, then installed libavcodec-dev again. Still got the same error when doing 'make'
    January 1, 2009 4:33 PM 
JS said...

    @iglooc00l:

    yes, it's the same problem as the other person. You need to remove any previous copy of these libraries (.a & .so). They have probably been installed using APT, so you may first try to remove them with 'apt-get remove libavcodec-dev', etc.

    If that doesn't work, just look for the offending files in /usr/lib and delete them (or move them to a backup directory if you're worried). Then just run 'ldconfig' to refresh the library cache and you should be fine.

    @Magnus:

    you need to check for older libs in /usr/lib. The ones in /usr/local/lib are the one you built :)

    Hi JS,
    what do I need to add to the config.xml to make mediatomb play DVD ISO files?
    The original config.xml contains only these two lines (less-than signs removed because of html code...):"

    treat mimetype="application/x-iso9660" as="dvd"/>
    treat mimetype="application/x-iso9660-image" as="dvd">

    Well, that's obviously not enough to make mediatomb recognize iso files so I added

    map from="iso" to="application/x-iso-9660-image"/>

    to the mappings section, but that did'nt help... My PS3 shows iso files on mediatomb as "incompatible data".

    As there's an extra import script (import-dvd.js) I assume a new category should show up if mediatomb recognizes an iso file?

    Maybe you could post the lines I need to add/edit in the config.xml?

    Oh, of course it's

    'sudo apt-get remove libavcodec-dev' and removing the .a and .so files in /usr/lib did the trick.

    Couldn't have done it without this blog. And I learned a LOT in the process, thanks a bunch JS.

    Now I just need to figure out how to set up transcoding =)

    sorry it took a bit to get back to you. I appreciate the fast response. After the initial tries it started spewing errors about gcc 4.2 and a bug. Rebooted the system and tried to compile ffmpegthumbnailer again and it succeeded! I now have all working that should be working. Not sure if thumbnails are supposed to show on the PS3 or not but I do have flac transcoding.

    Did I get you right when you said the ISO stuff is still not functional yet for the PS3?

    so first off thanks for such a great tutorial!! I am having one tiny problem with getting mediatomb to start properly. Everything compiled without errors but when I start mediatomb I get the following error:

    mediatomb: symbol lookup error: /usr/local/lib/libavcodec.so.52: undefined symbol: av_gcd

    I have tried reinstalling libavcodec without any luck. Any ideas? Thanks in advance!

Julien Simon said...

    @Bert: one way to do it is "System" > "Preferences" > "Sessions" and add mediatomb to the list.

    @Wheaties: this symbol is in libavutil. My guess is that you have an older version of the library in /usr/lib. You should either uninstall it, or define LD_LIBRARY_PATH in you .cshrc (or equivalent):

    LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/usr/local/lib:$LD_LIBRARY_PATH
    export LD_LIBRARY_PATH

    I thought I read in one of the TUT's, thanks by the way working great, that vlc was used in the past to stream the youtub content, or the apple trailers? if that's the case would it be possible to do the same with the iso files until mediatomb is ready? Iso saves so much space and for us poor folk means less $$

    Hi, thanks for an excellent guide. I myself is using Fedora so I had a lite bit of work to do before i got it all right. However when I read DVD:s (ISO) something goes wrong :


    libdvdnav: Using dvdnav version 4.1.3
    libdvdread: Using libdvdcss version 1.2.10 for DVD access
    libdvdnav: DVD Title: Jumper Sample - FDSCR
    libdvdnav: DVD Serial Number: 386C306300005321
    libdvdnav: DVD Title (Alternative):
    libdvdnav: Unable to find map file '/home/Caine/.dvdnav/Jumper Sample - FDSCR.map'
    libdvdnav: DVD disk reports itself with Region mask 0x00400000. Regions: 1 2 3 4 5 6 8


    Anyone else seen this? <:P

    Might add that i get this when i run the file from the ps3

    ERROR: DVD Image requested but title parameter is missing!

    the include path for mp4 support seems wrong. Its looking for mp4.h but no package provides that header file on Debian. Shouldn't this be mp4v2.h?

    When i transcode a .mkv file
    i get corrupt format.

    (on the top of my head, at work)
    in the terminal i can see a %in %out message beeing displayed twice.

    ffmpegthumbnailer however seems to be able to create a screenshot of the file .. This didn't go as smotth as i hoped < : )

    @Hed:

    AFAIK, ISO support isn't there yet (see http://juliensimon.blogspot.com/2009/01/status-update-on-mediatomb-012.html for more).

    Transcoding MKV is tricky (I don't do it myself). You should try converting the file from the command line using ffmpeg: if it doesn't work, then it's an ffmpeg issue, not a mediatomb issue.

    @julien

    Ahh my bad. I just thougt it was as i saw that you had it in your config. < = )

    about the matroska issue:
    ffmpeg seems to be working correctly.
    When i run it with the ffmpeg script is outputs allot of :

    [mpeg4 @ 0x9dc0c50]Invalid and inefficient vfw-avi packed B frames detected

    but other then that it keeps on going. I must confess that i don't really know what that in tails. Video en/decoding is very new to me. :P

    This is a great tutorial, and I've used it to install Mediatomb with 9.04 Jaunty. But I'm wondering how to install it so Mediatomb runs as a daemon, instead of forcing me to start it manually. There is nothing inside /etc/default/mediatomb and no program in the init.d folder. I'm also worried that if I install the daemon from the repository, it will overwrite this compiled version. Any suggestions?

    it is worth mentioning that jpeg support is only enabled when jpeglib is installed before configureing ffmpegthumbnailer

    apt-get install -y libjpeg62-dev

    Hi guys,
    I am new to ubuntu. I am trying to follow this utility. I installed ffmpegthumbnailer using apt, followed the rest of the tutorial using Jaunty, when I go to compile it says ffmpegthumbnailer ins not there. I installed it anyway and now I get the error "ERROR: /usr/share/mediatomb/web : 20 x No such file or directory"

    i can install mediatomb from apt, but I can't get my mp3 files to play so Itried this. Any suggestions

    Error on last post, I meant to say I am using Karmic, not Jaunty

  How to: Compile and run Mediatomb as a daemon with Ubuntu 9.04
    Since getting my PS3, then setting up my Ubuntu file server, I've really enjoyed watching movies on my TV. To get the media from computer to Playstation requires the use of software that employs the UPnP protocol, in the form of a DLNA ...

About me
Hello, my name is Julien SIMON. I live in the Paris area and I know a thing or two about computers. Feel free to visit me on LinkedIn.

"Your time is limited, so don't waste it living someone else's life. Don't be trapped by dogma â which is living with the results of other people's thinking. Don't let the noise of others' opinions drown out your own inner voice. And most important, have the courage to follow your heart and intuition. They somehow already know what you truly want to become. Everything else is secondary" - Steve Jobs, speech at Stanford University, June 2005

"Do you pirate water or electricity? No. Why? Because it's easier and safer to use the system provided by the utility company. And because whatever price they charge is acceptable to you, even if you don't really track it on a daily basis. And you don't have to worry if water will fit in this brand of cup, or if electricity will power this brand of coffee machine : it just WORKS. I believe that all digital content should follow this path" - Me, every time someone dares to mention DRM.
