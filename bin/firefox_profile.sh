Then create a new profile. If you want to make a copy of your existing profile, simply create the new profile, then copy the current profile directory to the new profile directory.

On Windows click Start > Run then:

echo "^C to break, anykey to create a new profile...";read readline

firefox -no-remote -ProfileManager & 

echo "next On *nix launch the command:
firefox -no-remote -P secondprofilename
