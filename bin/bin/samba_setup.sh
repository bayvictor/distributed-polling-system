Configuration

The main Samba configuration file is located in /etc/samba/smb.conf. The default configuration file has a significant amount of comments in order to document various configuration directives.
[Note] 	

Not all the available options are included in the default configuration file. See the smb.conf man page or the Samba HOWTO Collection for more details.

echo "
         workgroup = EXAMPLE
         ...
         security = user

      The security parameter is farther down in the [global] section, and is commented by default. Also, change EXAMPLE to better match your environment.

From a Windows client you should now be able to browse to the Ubuntu file server and see the shared directory. To check that everything is working try creating a directory from Windows.

To create additional shares simply create new [dir] sections in /etc/samba/smb.conf, and restart Samba. Just make sure that the directory you want to share actually exists and the permissions are correct.
