#Rhythmbox as Media Server (UPnP/DLNA)

#You can configure Rhythmbox to act as central media server using its built in plugin support. Using this ability you can access your media(music or videos) from remote location.
#Installation

#First you need to install python-coherence package.

sudo apt-get -y install python-coherence

#Now open Rhythmbox >> Edit >> Plugins and check DLNA/UPnP sharing and control support. From now onwards when ever you start rhythmbox all of your UPnP compatiable devices and software applications will show the Rhythmbox served media server.
