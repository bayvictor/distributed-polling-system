# MOCKING DATA STREAM GENERATION<br>
try to put all opensource codes found here in github together -- which polls, and indexes distributed item on the cloud.
<br><br>
A lot of existing codes here but our collections differ in below:<br>
1. Put all relevant codes together here, keep the original license and IP notes.<br>
2. When experimenting different branches, notes will be put for bugs, to do, or core value of certain branches here.<br>
<br><br>
The public open source experiments and evaluated notes will be noted by date in form of diary for later reference.

We are focusing on only mocking data-stream generating here!<br>
1) search here in github for "tenant", ranked by stars, found top 10 worth further experiments.<br>
2) Is it working? If several of top 20 of them be added with "masks" for mocking a data-source of "mocking multitenant" source? This is opensource, safe and economic touch-stone for prototyping (may be proprietary) any analytic engine or advisor system as smoke test before real-data stream swimming.<br>
3) What elemments can be added to make tenant system "real"? (3.1) time-freq pattern trigger certain random push; (3.2) some geo-distributed random LBS added; (3.3) some PC t-shirt auto-tayloring; (3.4) some consuming pattern generated for (bandwidth, storage, load balance ); (3.5)list continue, added later for benefiting the community.<br>
4) Consuming resource simulation(CRS). (CPU core number, RAM size, ssd storage, hd storage, cloud-nas storage, time, network heat-map, micro-service kubenetes number, pod number, load balance iRule number; <any-pair>:D=="any keyword":"any random in ANY-RANGE" -pairing generator ).<br>
With above CRS in mind, smoothen out the better behavor (algorthm, curve-masks ) to generate the mocking tenant data.<br>
Later we can even generate specific "Mocking" CRS in any industrial domain, like POS, cellular network, Highway sensor network, retailer PC network, ATM network, sport-car motion sensor data; etc.<br>
We believe above "mocking" system data will nenefit the human being, and speed up innovations! So we calling full domain volunteers  adding his "mocking data water cocks" here!<br>
<br><br>

In any above "tenant" search hit branches, for modification meeting "mocking function", we have to add rest API, universal, simple "push data adapters" and "land-lord convention" for it qualified a "mocking tenant system" to act ! -- with a good API to the eco system!

One of the answers for the above said open source "NETWORK SIMULATOR" is ns-3. <br><br>
On ns-3 a lot of simulation studies are done like ( a 24-hour Scenario of Luxembourg City for SUMO
Traffic simulations {https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Lara_Codeca/publication/276063017_LuST_a_24-hour_Scenario_of_Luxembourg_City_for_SUMO_Traffic_simulations/links/555080f608ae12808b381148.pdf}, which is using open source ns-3 to simulate a mid-size city, real traffic in a whole day).<br><br>
By reading through of it, this work can be used for any-nature "network simulation". While it's in node size 1k-10k network simulation, whether it's nodes and edges mapped to "high way shoulders" and "local roads", it can be mapped into any nodes/edges models, image those couples can be:<br><br>
1. in IC design automation (EDA), it can be : nodes = gates; edges = wires;<br>
2. In P2P mobile network design, it can be: nodes = cellphone-peers; edges = wifi connection;<br>
3. in drone IoT network, nodes = drones; edge01's = wifi; edge02's = cellular connection on 3G or 4G network.<br>
4. ...<br><br>
5. On "back bone network" for ISP, the "ns-3" teamplate can be sure to emulate when: nodes = switches and gateways; edges = wifi and cable connections.<br><br>

So with this success story, we put a reading note here to point out, the design of cloud can be automated like CHIP/IC design, on the same scale (node numbers, data flow), as well as time-to-market, which is mature and comparable!<br><br>

So far with above study of open-source works, any domain from the anology with "network simulation" mentioned above can simplify POC in a grate variety of domain modeling!<br>
As result, this "mocking network" by simulation, it can be nothing on IP, but a sharping stone for your IP, where all intelligence and labor on and being protected!<br>

Notes on setting up open source python scikit, -- the random-forest-algorithm:<br>
Install python pip, best practice:<br>
wget https://bootstrap.pypa.io/get-pip.py<br>
python 3 get-pip.py ## better on win7 use c:\Python27, instead of cygwin python.<br>
git clone git://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn.git<br>

For machine learning, there is a data collecting website:https://data.world/. It is so called social networking by dataset collectors, <br>
we see here there are a lot of public data sources (demographic data, etc), which can be used for training prototypes of machine learning model, <br>
like scikit-learn, spark, mahout, tensorflow, etc. Strongly recommended!  <br><br>
Because it's also a circle of data scientists, good for probling here! :) <br><br>
