# MOCKING DATA STREAM GENERATION<br>
try to put all opensource codes found here in github together -- which polls, and indexes distributed item on the cloud.
<br><br>
A lot of existing codes here but we differs:<br>
1. Put all relevant codes together here, keep the original license and IP notes.<br>
2. When experimenting different branches, notes will be put for bugs, to do, or core value of certain branches here.<br>
<br><br>
The public open source experiments and evaluated notes will be noted by date in form of diary for later reference.

We are focusing on only mocking data-stream generating here!<br>
1) search here in github for "tenant", ranked by stars, found top 10 worth further experiments.<br>
2) Is it working? If several of top 20 of them be added with "masks" for mocking a data-source of "mocking multitenant" source? This is safe and economic for prototyping any analytic engine or advisor system as smoke test before real-data stream swimming.<br>
3) What elemments can be added to make tenant system "real"? (3.1) time-freq pattern trigger certain random push; (3.2) some geo-distributed random LBS added; (3.3) some PC t-shirt auto-tayloring; (3.4) some consuming pattern generated for (bandwidth, storage, load balance ); (3.5)list continue, added later for benefiting the community.<br>
4) Consuming resource simulation(CRS). (CPU core number, RAM size, ssd storage, hd storage, cloud-nas storage, time, network heat-map, micro-service kubenetes number, pod number, load balance iRule number; <any-pair>:D=="any keyword":"any random in ANY-RANGE" -pairing generator ).<br>
With above CRS in mind, smoothen out the better behavor (algorthm, curve-masks ) to generate the mocking tenant data.<br>
Later we can even generate specific "Mocking" CRS in any industrial domain, like POS, cellular network, Highway sensor network, retailer PC network, ATM network, sport-car motion sensor data; etc.<br>
We believe above "mocking" system data will nenefit the human being, and speed up innovations! So we calling full domain volunteers  adding his "mocking data water cocks" here!<br>
