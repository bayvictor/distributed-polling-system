(2) Laser bending: However a beam *can* be deflected or focused by a magnetic field if it is propagating through something called a "magneto-optic" material. In fact, in the field of optics, we often *do* use magneto-optic materials, as well as electro-optic, acousto-optic, etc

Google-stablemate DeepMind is creating a blockchain-like system to show how sensitive medical data passing through its processors will be used, allowing healthcare professionals to check if data has been tampered with.

LendingRobot, without human intervention, making use of Amazon Web Services’ machine learning, compute servers and blockchain technology.

The investment is attractive, as it can yield 8-10 percent interest paid monthly. But managing the choice of those multiple loans, and investing, re-investing and collecting interest, can get complex and boring, which is why LendingRobot has automated those tasks, taking a fee for its services.
LendingRobot says it serves 6,500 clients with more than $120 million in assets. The company was founded in 2012 by founding CEO Gilad Golan and Marot, who first met at Microsoft and shared an interest in making personal Lending Club investments.

 automated trust computations:

Finance companies calculate credit scores for loan/credit card decisions.
Peer to Peer companies make decisions on whom to onboard to their platform.
Tech companies detect whether content on their site is fake.
Law enforcement agencies use models to identify potential criminal activity.
Yet as trust is becoming increasingly crucial, it is becoming harder to build systems for automated trust decisions.

Advisory Points of Improvements, in a 'tight' enterprise environment:

1. Communication: poise, tempo and control, always ask "am I on the same page with you? "
2. Proactive Report & interactions with multi-tier, multi-source managers.
3. R&D, Always deliver with visible, phony results at daily, weekly period; have something special for team-player to consume.
4. Don't just be a mentor/consultant, be a stake-holder, and a agressive contributor.

(1) AI工程#1:技术涉及到大量数据，一旦选定云平台，基本上就被锁死了。Google就是利用TF来作为客户上云的抓手。它在TF平台开发的投入上超过200人，确保对AI平台的垄断。
(2)AI学术#1:MS的目标是在所有云上的SaaS服务都引入AI，让用户有更好的体验。
(3) 差异性可以是
数据，基于数据的模型和调优
计算速度，数据吞吐量，网络时延
专业领域产品，服务，或解决方案

09/11/2017: Interesting notes of cool, trendy laptop notes:

http://forum.notebookreview.com/threads/good-notebook-for-15mm-hdd-st5000lm000-and-64gb-ram.802324/
Topic 1: 15mm z-height, thick 5GB hdd, fitting into laptops.
Some laptops like Sager p650 can stack two hard drives and can stack two hard drives on top of each other. That could allow 15mm drive to fit, but it would have no room for the other 1TB drive. It has 2x m.2 lots though.
old alienware m18x could stack three hard drives on top of each other, but i'm not aware of any other new laptops that supports 15mm drive.
Topic 2: selecting nvme x4 m2 sdd:
I remember that GT70 that I used to have, had a lot of drive space, but it is outdated as well. It could fit 15mm drive and fit another 9mm drive on the second HDD bay.

Roundup
2017 Guide: The Best PCI Express NVMe Solid State Drives
1) SSDs that adhere to the NVMe protocol are the fastest storage drives you can buy today. Here's how to shop for one with confidence.
2) These slots are known as M.2 slots, and they accept M.2 SSDs that look like sticks of silicon chewing gum.
3) In practice, all of the upgrader- or PC-builder-minded M.2 SSDs and slots we have seen to date have been 22mm wide, so you can expect this number to start with "22." The most common lengths are 80mm (“M.2 Type-2280”) and 60mm (“M.2 Type-2260”). Drives as short as 42mm ("M.2 Type-2242") or as long as 110mm ("M.2 Type-22110") do exist, though. Why the differences in length? The longer the drive's PCB, the more surface area it will have onto which chips can fit.

 Today’s new high-end M.2 drives support PCI Express x4 (four lanes of bandwidth), working alongside a technology called Non-Volatile Memory Express (NVMe). The idea behind NVMe is to accelerate performance further, especially with hardy workloads.
4) NVMe, (Intel's "Kaby Lake" 7th Generation chips, based on chipsets like the Z270) support PCI Express x4 NVMe M.2 drives.
Many recent M.2-equipped mobos support both bus types of M.2 SSD (M.2 SATA and M.2 PCI Express/NVMe).
5) NVMe in Other Shapes: PCI Cards and U.2;  
6) Desktop: And, in the case of PCI Express M.2, an older motherboard may not support PCI Express x4, only x2!)

MSI GT73VR TITAN-017 --- 2 NVMe, 1 M.2 non-NVMe, 1 2.5
